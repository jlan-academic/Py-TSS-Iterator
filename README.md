# Py-TSS-Iterator
A small Python package for automation of iterative analyses to produce true stress-strain curves with FEA.

IterativeAnalysis.py is the main script, and uses the modules CommonFunctions.py and UserFunctions.py
Validation.py also uses the same modules.

UserFunctions.py will need to be updated for the specific FEA package and project being used.

Example.zip contains an example of a project using this package, including an Ansys Workbench (archive) file to demonstrate the structure of the FEA "skeleton project".
